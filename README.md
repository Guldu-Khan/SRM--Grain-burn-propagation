# Image boundary propagator

Level set method is employed in propagating the edges of a B/W image.

In this particular application of the Level set method, the image is of a star configuration with constant speed of propogation. The profile of the grain and its web is essential to determining the solid rocket motor dynamics which in turn determines the trajectory of the rocket and consequently its mission. This is the most crititcal step in predicting the motor dynamics.

A novel approach is employed wherin only an image of the grain needs to be supplied. This can handle multiply connected domains and extremely complex contours. No human intervention is required after initialization. This helps in subsequent optimization which may be employed.

Shortcomings with other naive techniques are also shown in initial attempts.
